  [1] GENERAL INFORMATION
  =======================


cw is (yet another) package for the Catweasel controller, look below what
other packages do exist. This package is especially for accessing the floppy
drives connected to Catweasel. Currently the MK3 and MK4 controller cards
are supported. cw consists of a kernel driver and a companion user space
program. The kernel driver should work with Linux 2.4 and 2.6. Look at the
homepage of the manufacturer http://www.jschoenfeld.com/ for more details
about the controller features.

RFDI: (request for disk images) To support more formats i need raw disk
      images. I am especially interested in C1571, C1581 and Apple-Images,
      if you have such disks, please use to following command:
      # cwtool -R -v raw_14 /dev/cw0raw0 - | bzip2 -c - > image.cwraw.bz2
      to create a raw disk image (/dev/cw0raw0 is the first drive on the
      first controller, you need to change that if you use another drive).

NOTE: There are 3 other Linux drivers for the Catweasel controller:

      catweasel(*) - http://llg.cubic.org/cw/, written by Dirk Jagdmann. A
      Linux driver for SID, Joysticks and Amiga keyboard. If you also want
      to use this package together with cw, remember to set MODULE_NAME to
      a different name, because catweasel uses the same name for the driver
      module (see the installation instructions below).

      cwfloppy(*) - http://www.soundtracker.org/raw/cwfloppy/, written by
      Michael Krause. A Linux driver for accessing the floppies on a
      Catweasel controller. This driver exports block devices, so you are
      able to mount Amiga disks under Linux. Currently it supports Amiga
      and MSDOS disks (and C1541 with a patch written by me). To support
      more formats i found it more useful to use another method to export
      data to user space, thats why i started my own driver. Instead of a
      block device cw uses a char device and passes the raw Catweasel data
      to the calling program, so all format routines do not reside in the
      kernel driver anymore.

      cw2dmk - http://www.tim-mann.org/catweasel.html, written by Tim Mann.
      A Linux driver (other platforms are also supported) for accessing the
      floppies on a Catweasel Controller, especially TRS80 related formats
      are supported. This package does not use a kernel driver to access
      the Catweasel controller, but you should avoid using this program
      when a kernel driver from another package is loaded.

      (*) Currently you may load only one kernel module accessing the
          Catweasel controller at the same time.

NOTE: If you want to read both sides of a C1541 disk you need to modify
      your 5.25" floppy drive, because of the missing index hole on the
      flip side, look at http://home.t-online.de/home/indcomp/flipside.html
      for more details.

NOTE: There is a difference between 3.5 inch HD and DD disks, especially when
      HD disks are written in a DD drive, below is an explanation shamelessly
      stolen from Michael Krause's cwfloppy README:

      "... The small hole in the upper left corner DOES make a difference.
      Back when you've been buying lots of disks, it was NOT just some trick
      of the floppy disk industry to make you buy expensive HD disks when
      you thought you could get away with cheap DD disks :-)
      
      When you insert an HD disk into an HD floppy drive, the floppy drive
      actually changes physical parameters, for example magnetization
      thresholds and writing current strength. A floppy drive does not and
      can not write an HD disk in HD format with the same physical
      parameters as a DD disk in DD format!
      
      If you use HD disks with HD format and DD disks with DD format,
      everything's fine. However, at some time in the nineties, the floppy
      disk industry stopped selling DD disks. Because many Amiga users still
      relied on the DD format (only the Amiga 4000 has an HD drive), they
      simply took HD disks and used them in their DD drives.  Some users
      covered the HD indicator hole with a piece of tape, some didn't.
      Because their drives were only DD drives, the drive didn't care -- so
      it really didn't make a difference either! Most HD disks seem to work
      fine this way, even though they have been constructed for HD
      formatting. In fact, I've never come across an HD disk that could NOT
      be used in an Amiga DD drive. There have been people claiming
      otherwise, though.
      
      However, if you insert an HD disk formatted in DD format into an HD
      drive, you HAVE to take care to cover the HD indicator hole! If you do
      not do this, the drive will think it is an HD formatted disk and
      adjust its physical parameters accordingly, leading to READ and/or
      WRITE ERRORS on a basically fine disk! Unfortunately, this can not be
      worked around in software.
      
      So, if somebody gives you a disk with an HD hole and you can not mount
      it as either Amiga HD or MS-DOS HD, it could be a perfectly fine DD
      formatted disk -- only your drive is in the wrong mode to read it
      without errors, because it detects the uncovered HD hole and thinks it
      is in HD format. Cover the hole with some piece of tape, and
      everything will be fine.
      
      If you don't believe me, try this:
      
      - Get an HD disk with open hole and try formatting it in, say, Amiga DD
        mode using your Catweasel with a standard contemporary HD floppy drive.
        It doesn't work.. the validation gives lots of errors.
      
      - Try the same with the HD hole covered. It should work, provided the
        disk is not damaged and it is not one of the few HD disks that
        really don't work in DD mode.
      
      - Now that the disk has been formatted correctly in DD mode, look
        at the histogram, you can clearly distinguish the three different
	MFM magnetization pulse time intervals.
      
      - Now remove the tape from the HD hole and look at the histogram
        again. How can anybody expect to recover any data from this disk
        now? :-) ..."

  [2] SHORT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
  ============================


To build cw a simple 'make' should be enough, remember that you need the
header files from your running kernel in order to compile the driver module.
cw was tested under different distributions with Linux kernel versions
2.4.26, 2.4.32, 2.6.11.2 and 2.6.14.2 (all directly taken from
http://www.kernel.org/), it was also succesfully compiled on Knoppix 4.0.2.

You may build cwtool with dietlibc, just set and export the environment
variable DIET to the location of your 'diet' binary and run 'make'. Dietlibc
is a libc that is optimized for small size, look at
http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/ for more.


  ===================================
  [3] SHORT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  ===================================


NOTE: The file conf/cwtoolrc.default contains the configuration for all
      currently supported disk formats, this file is also compiled into
      cwtool (you may see the contents with cwtool -D). You may also place a
      customized version of this file to /etc/cwtoolrc or $HOME/.cwtoolrc,
      so cwtool will load it on every start up. But currently there is no
      description how such a file has to look like, because the directive
      names and syntax may change in future versions. For easy changes
      such as a different number of sectors per track you should use
      conf/cwtoolrc.default as a template. If you write disks you may find
      the directives 'skew' and 'interleave' interesting to change the sector
      order on writing, both expect a positive decimal number. You may
      experiment with the following command (yes the line break is ok, but
      you may also write it in one line):
      # cwtool -W -v -v -e 'disk "test" { format "gcr_cbm" sectors 21
            skew 0 interleave 0 track 0 { } }' test /dev/zero /dev/null
      First change the number after 'skew' and then after 'interleave'
      to see the effect. You may also write the string after option -e to a
      file and use the option -f to let cwtool read this file.

NOTE: You need to be root to do the things described below.

NOTE: If you use a device file system like devfs or udev you have to
      determine yourself how to add the device nodes permanently.

You may use cw without calling 'make install' if you do the following steps
manually:

1a) load the module
    # insmod module/cw.o		(Linux 2.4)
    # insmod module/cw.ko		(Linux 2.6)

1b) make sure the module was loaded correctly
    # lsmod
    # dmesg | tail
    The first command prints out a list of all loaded kernel modules, the
    second prints out kernel messages, the last lines should contain
    messages from cw.

2)  create the device nodes (up to 4 controllers are supported, every
    controller may have up to 2 floppy drives)
    # mknod /dev/cw0raw0 c 120 31
    # mknod /dev/cw0raw1 c 120 63
    # mknod /dev/cw1raw0 c 120 95
    # mknod /dev/cw1raw1 c 120 127
    # mknod /dev/cw2raw0 c 120 159
    # mknod /dev/cw2raw1 c 120 191
    # mknod /dev/cw3raw0 c 120 223
    # mknod /dev/cw3raw1 c 120 255

3a) run cwtool to read a disk (in this case: read an Amiga 3.5 inch DD disk
    from the first drive on the first controller and write it to image.adf)
    # bin/cwtool -R -v amiga_dd /dev/cw0raw0 image.adf

3b) Writing a disk is similar (in this case: write image.d64 to a C1541
    5.25 inch disk in the second drive of the first controller)
    # bin/cwtool -W -v c1541 image.d64 /dev/cw0raw1

3c) Look at the man page of cwtool, to get an overview what other things
    are possible
    # man doc/cwtool.1

If you use 'make install' to install cw then /etc/modules.conf (Linux 2.4)
or /etc/modprobe.conf (Linux 2.6) will be modified to allow automatic module
loading. Per default it uses char major number 120, if this major number is
already in use (look at /proc/devices) you need to choose a different number,
use the command 'make install MAJOR=xx', where xx is a free char major number
on your system. The following parameters are also possible, if these
parameters are not specified more or less useful default values are used.

BIN_DIR      - directory in which cwtool is installed
MAN_DIR      - the man page will be copied to $MAN_DIR/man1
MODULE_DIR   - directory in which the kernel driver module is installed
MODULE_NAME  - the name of the module (you need to choose a different name
               than 'cw' if you also use the catweasel package)
MODULES_CONF - full path of the modules.conf or modprobe.conf file

NOTE: You may use 'make upgrade' if you want to upgrade from an older
      version of cw, but you need to specify parameters differing from the
      default values. Upgrading just means overwriting cwtool, the kernel
      module and the man page with the current versions.

NOTE: You may use 'make uninstall' to uninstall cw, the parameters of
      the last 'make install' call are saved and are used for uninstalling,
      but after a 'make clean' these saved parameters will be lost.
